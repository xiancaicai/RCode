# RCode
For projects, tasks and tests written in R.

## Linear Regression, Confidence Intervals and t-Tests
**Code:** [2021_LinReg_CI_tTest.R] (https://github.com/xiancaicai/RCode/blob/main/2021_LinReg_CI_tTest.R)
Instead of using built-in functions or packages in R, I here have coded functions which executes linear regression, computes confidence intervals and t-Tests (both classical and stratified). This helps in understanding how the actual math works behind the functions so-often used.

## Frequentist vs Bayesian estimation
**Code:** [2021_ResDev_IRLS_Boots_MCMC.R] (https://github.com/xiancaicai/RCode/blob/main/2021_ResDev_IRLS_Boots_MCMC.R)
Here, functions have been built to calculate Residual Deviance, perform Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares, Monte Carlo Metropolis Hastings simulations, as well as Bootstrap sampling and estimation, to compare Frequentist and Bayesian estimation.
